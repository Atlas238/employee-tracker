# Employee Tracker

## Description
A Command line database management tool that allows a user to view database information in a concise manner, without having to run SQL commands directly. 

## Current Issues
Will most likely be resubmitting - ran into persistent issues with console.log messages being blocked by our main menu and could not find a work around before the due-date. Will most likely be starting from scratch to fix display issues for resubmission as well as including additional functionalities.

- Display will randomly be cut off by main menu prompt, very rarely in the middle of option chains (in the middle of creating a new role)

- All options will successfully run (database queries return information as expected, adds, deletes, etc all function) but can be near impossible to distinguish when an option has finished and a user is returned to the 'main menu'
